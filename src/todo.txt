- The Game Window is resizable, therefore the positions of racket, ball and
  the other components should be adjusted when resizing.

- Create a menu:
•  Selecting Player 1 & player 2 names
• Setting the speed of the ball
• Adjust the dimensions (size, thickness) of the racket
• Setting the score that ends the game (player wins if they score as many goals)
• Exiting the game
• Set how often the ball speed should increase

- Model concepts (e.g. Ball, Player, etc.) are defined separately and
abstraction/encapsulation is evident
